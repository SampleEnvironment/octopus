# Octopy
Octopy is SECoP in a publish/subscribe, topics based environment: an industrial IOT centered solution with an EPICS connection.

At https://gitlab.esss.lu.se/mesi/octopy you can find a SECoP implementation that came to existence due to the need of marrying EPICS PV:s with SECoP.
The common ground where we share data and collect metadata is MQTT. With MQTT comes the benefits of using existent MQTT libraries available for most programming langue's as well as for PLC:s and other hardware giving access to a vast collection of software developed by the IOT community like communication gateways(SMS, Jabber, Slack etc.), database access, and more.
This implementation will also be suitable for a non-programmer or beginner due to access to tools like Node-red etc.
